# FYP Report - GrowWise System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the Final Year Project (FYP) report and documentation for the GrowWise System.

## Getting Started


### Setup Instructions

1. **Unzip the Project Files**
   - Extract the `F25_116 (1).zip` file to access all project materials
   - Upload the extracted content directly to the LaTeX website for compilation

2. **Generate Class Diagram**
   - The class diagram code is located in `GrowWise_System_Class_Diagram.puml`
   - Copy the PlantUML code from this file
   - Paste it on the PlantUML website (https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/)
   - The diagram may appear slightly jumbled initially but will render correctly

## Report Structure

### Required Sections to Complete

#### 4.9 Database Design
This section is required if you are using a database system. Note: If using NoSQL, you will not provide an ER diagram but other design elements and data dictionary should still be included.

**4.9.1 ER Diagram**
- Create an Entity-Relationship diagram for the database design
- Show relationships between entities
- Include primary keys, foreign keys, and cardinalities

**4.9.2 Data Dictionary**
- Document all database tables and their attributes
- Include data types, constraints, and descriptions
- Provide field-level documentation

#### 5.5 Domain Model/Class Diagram
- The PlantUML code for this diagram is already created in `GrowWise_System_Class_Diagram.puml`
- Use the PlantUML website to generate the visual diagram
- This represents the system's domain model and class relationships

## Important Notes

- **No Sequence Diagrams Required**: This report does not need sequence diagrams
- **AI Report Status**: The AI report has been sent to Saad and the library. Updates will be provided once responses are received
- **LaTeX Compilation**: Upload the unzipped folder contents directly to the LaTeX website for proper compilation

## File Structure

```

└── venv/                        # Python virtual environment
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the ER Diagram for section 4.9.1
2. Create the Data Dictionary for section 4.9.2
3. Generate the Class Diagram using PlantUML
4. Compile the LaTeX document with all completed sections
5. Await feedback from Saad and library regarding the AI report
